Since Marcus joined our group for Part 2, but did Part 1 separately, we made some minor changes
when merging our protocols together. For the registration commands, we followed the protocol on 
Mika and Serena's protocol writeup, but adjusted the initial client message to be
A-> S: {A, REGISTER, password, uid, tod, K_ds, sig}K_otp, {K_otp}K_AS
where K_otp is a one time key used for the server and client to communicate out of session during
a register request.
