Since Marcus joined our group for Part 2, but did Part 1 separately, we made some minor changes
when merging our protocols together. The primary change was switching Marcus's Phase 2
protocol to use the current time Tod instead of a nonce in messages.

For the registration commands, we followed the protocol on 
Mika and Serena's protocol writeup, but adjusted the initial client message to be
A-> S: {A, REGISTER, password, uid, tod, K_ds, sig}K_otp, {K_otp}K_AS
where K_otp is a one time key used for the server and client to communicate out of session during
a register request. 

For LOGIN requests, we made no protocol changes to Marcus's (besides the time vs a random nonce)

For CHANGE_PASS we also followed Marcus's protocol (again with the time vs random nonce)
